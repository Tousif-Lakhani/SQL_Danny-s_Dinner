**SQL_Danny's_Dinner_Case_Study**
In this SQL project, I have solved week 1 of the 8 week sql challenge, with minimal external assistance. The case study I solved was about Danny who seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a 
risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of the assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business. To create the captured data
I have attached Danny's_Table_code sql file.

I used MYSQL and used intermediate queries to help Danny with his data.
